To deal with conflicts

  Git provides support for a number of graphical diff tools, and you can 
  even add your own. 
  See http://gitguru.com/2009/02/22/integrating-git-with-a-visual-merge-tool/

  apt-get install <diffuse> or <meld>

  git mergetool -t <diffuse or merge>

  Use the tool to merge the <file>-LOCAL and <file>-REMOTE into <file>,
    then when you're done commit the changes.

  git checkout <branch-name> <filename>

To set a local branch to track a remote branch
