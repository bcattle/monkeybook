In order to run tests, the db user account needs the ability to create and drop
databases. To grant this permission run the following line from the mysql shell:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `test\_%`.* TO `testuser`@`localhost`;

This lets testuser do anything to databases that begin with the 'test_' prefix.
